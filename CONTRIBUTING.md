# Contributing to OpenAmber

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenAmber! This project aims to create open infrastructure for missing child alerts across Europe.

## Project Status

OpenAmber is currently in the **specification phase**. We are seeking funding through the NGI Zero Commons Fund to develop the reference implementation. 

## How You Can Help

### 1. Protocol Feedback

We welcome feedback on the protocol specification: 

- **Schema design:** Are the data fields appropriate?  Too much?  Too little?
- **Privacy considerations:** Have we missed any GDPR implications?
- **Security model:** Are there attack vectors we haven't considered? 
- **Interoperability:** Will this work with existing systems?

Open an issue with the label `protocol-feedback`.

### 2. Use Case Documentation

Help us understand how different organizations would use OpenAmber:

- **116 000 hotlines:** What are your current technical pain points?
- **Media outlets:** How do you currently receive and verify alerts?
- **NGOs:** What integration would be most valuable?
- **Developers:** What SDK features would you need?

### 3. Translation

- Protocol specification
- User guides
- Integration documentation

We especially need translations in:  French, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Dutch. 

### 4. Technical Review

If you have expertise in: 

- **Cryptography:** Review our Ed25519 signing approach
- **JSON-LD:** Review our schema design
- **ActivityPub:** Review federation compatibility
- **GDPR:** Review privacy compliance
